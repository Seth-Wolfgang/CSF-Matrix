# Issues because I forgot and had to remember after winter break:
* Eigen vector has 0's in it
Issue could be caused by things being casted to int.
* Eigen vector is not being properly converted to SRLE -> But its close! Test case did show its working, but random case does NOT

* Optimize Optimize Optimize

* Turn iterator into a subclass of the constructor


# Optional:
* Write actual tests! Secondary effect -> make Dr. Fredericks proud


Good news: We're close and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel :)
