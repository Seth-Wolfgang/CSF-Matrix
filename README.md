# Compressed Sparse Fiber Compression (CSF) Library

## To Do:

 - Overall
    - Get overall file structure approved
    - Start benchmarking compression levels
    - start benchmarking iterator performance

 - Constructor
    - implement a non-destructive constructor
    - implement a dedicated eigen constructor instead of just a wrapper
    
 - Iterator
    - template out compression levels for different iterators
    - implement iterator into new file structure
