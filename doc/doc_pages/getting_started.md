This page serves as the main entry point for those looking to jump into coding with CSF. 
This page will go through how to get CSF, how to compile it, how to use it, and where to learn more about it.

@section getting_csf Getting CSF

@subsection install_csf Installing CSF

In order to use CSF you need to download the CSF header library. This can be done from our Github Repository. 
It's also highly recommended to also install Eigen as well, specifically the Eigen Sparse Core module. 
Further instructions on how to install Eigen can be found on their website. The process for CSF should be similar to Eigen by design.
